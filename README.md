# HTAP with MariaDB Community Server 10.5

[MariaDB Community Server 10.5](https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/whats-new-in-mariadb-community-server-10-5/) has many enhancements that will provide an improved user experience with faster performance and improved manageability. 

Earlier versions of [MariaDB ColumnStore](https://mariadb.com/docs/features/mariadb-columnstore/) have been available to the open source community as a separate fork of MariaDB. Now, with MariaDB Community Server 10.5, [ColumnStore 1.5](https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/mariadb-columnstore-1-5-now-available-with-mariadb-community-server-10-5/) is included as a pluggable storage engine making a columnar storage engine for analytics easily available to MariaDB Community Server users out-of-the-box. 

MariaDB ColumnStore can be deployed as the analytics component of MariaDB's single stack [Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP)](https://mdbcdt.com/DOCS-2032/solutions/htap/#htap) solution or as a standalone columnar database for interactive, ad hoc analytics at scale.


**The following is a walkthrough to get you up and running with a MariaDB Community Server (with ColumnStore) (using a Docker Image) and an HTAP database instance in less than 15 minutes.** 

## Prerequisites 

Before getting started with this walkthrough you need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 

## Overview

This walk-through will step you through the process of installing, accessing and configuring HTAP within a MariaDB Community Server (with ColumnStore) instance.

### 1. Installing single-node instance

Pull down the [MariaDB Community Server (with ColumnStore) image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mariadb/columnstore) and create a new container by executing the following command in a terminal window:

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 3306:3306 --name mcs_container mariadb/columnstore
```

### 2. Enter the newly created container

```bash
$ docker exec -it mcs_container bash
```

### 3. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) using [yum](http://yum.baseurl.org/)

```bash
$ yum install git
```

### 4. Clone this repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/dev-example-htap-community.git
```

### 5. Create schemas and load data

This repository includes the following schemas:

* innodb_db (database)
    * airlines (table) 
    * airports (table) - all airports within the United States of America
    * flights (table)
* columnstore_db (database)
    * flights (table)

In this sample, the [create_and_load.sh](create_and_load.sh) script will be used to create the schemas (via [schema.sql](sql/schema.sql)) and load the following tables:

* innodb_db.airlines - using [data/airlines.csv](data/airlines.csv)
* innodb_db.airports - using [data/airports.csv](data/airports.csv)
* columnstore.db_flights - using [data/flights.csv](data/flights.csv)

Execute the script to create schemas and load data.

```bash
$ ./create_and_load.sh
```

You should output similar to the following:

```
creating schema...
schema created
loading data...
- airlines.csv loaded into innodb_db.airlines
- airports.csv loaded into innodb_db.airports
Locale = en_US.UTF-8Column delimiter : ,
Enclosed by Character : "

```

Confirm that schema creation and data loading has been successful.

1. Access MariaDB 

```bash
$ mariadb
```

2. Confirm databases have been created.

```sql
$ SHOW DATABASES();
```

You should see the following output:
```
+---------------------+
| Database            |
+---------------------+
| calpontsys          |
| columnstore_db      |
| columnstore_info    |
| infinidb_querystats |
| information_schema  |
| innodb_db           |
| mysql               |
| performance_schema  |
+---------------------+
```

3. View table content (and confirm they have data)

```sql
$ SELECT COUNT(*) FROM innodb_db.airlines;
$ SELECT COUNT(*) FROM innodb_db.airports;
$ SELECT COUNT(*) FROM columnstore_db.flights;
```

And because there is a Cross Engine user included within the Community Server 10.5 container you can also test out cross engine (ex. innodb_db <-> columnstore_db) joins.

```sql
$ SELECT a.airline, AVG(f.dep_delay) FROM innodb_db.airlines a INNER JOIN columnstore_db.flights f ON a.iata_code = f.carrier GROUP BY a.airline ORDER BY a.airline;
```

```bash
+-------------------------+------------------+
| airline                 | AVG(f.dep_delay) |
+-------------------------+------------------+
| Air Wisconsin Airlines  |           9.6194 |

```

4. Exit MariaDB

```bash
$ exit
```

### 6. [Server configuration](https://mariadb.com/docs/deploy/community-htap/#server-configuration)

The following configuration changes will be used to set up replication between innodb_db and columnstore_db. 

Open /etc/my.cnf.d/columnstore.cnf for editing.

```bash 
$ vi /etc/my.cnf.d/columnstore.cnf
```
Make the following configuration changes:

```bash
# Required for Schema Sync
server-id = 1
log_bin=mariadb-bin
log_slave_updates = OFF
binlog_format = STATEMENT

# HTAP filtering rules

# 1. Transactions are replicated from itself
replicate_same_server_id = ON

# 2. Only write queries that touch innodb_db to the binary log
binlog_do_db = tx

# 3. Rewrite innodb_db to columnstore_db prior to applying transaction
replicate_rewrite_db = tx->ax
```

Optional: If you want to restrict replication to occur on certain tables you can use `replicate_wild_do_table`.

```bash
# 4. Only replicate tables that begin with "htap"
replicate_wild_do_table = columnstore_db.htap%
```

Save file and exit. 

### 7. [Starting MariaDB replication](https://mariadb.com/docs/deploy/community-htap/#starting-mariadb-replication)


```bash
$ mariadb < sql/replication.sql
```

### 8. Restart MariaDB container 

```bash
$ exit
$ docker restart mcs_container
```

Then, when running again, re-enter the container.

```bash
$ docker exec -it mcs_container bash
```

### 9. Restart MariaDB ColumnStore

```bash 
$ columnstore-restart
```

### 10. Test replication

You can test replication by inserting a new record into `innodb_db.flights` and confirming that it exists in `columnstore_db.flights`.

1. Access MariaDB

```bash
$ mariadb
```

2. Insert a new record into `innodb_db.flights`.

```sql
$ USE innodb_db;
$ INSERT INTO flights VALUES (2020, 6, 25, 1, '2020-6-25', 'DL', 'N9999', 1000, 'ORD', 'LAX', '0600', '0600', 10);
```

3. Confirm the new record exists in `columnstore_db.flights`.

```sql
$ SELECT * FROM columnstore_db.flights WHERE year = 2020;
```
